<blockquote>
  <p>Clickworkers are the invisible workforce behind today's AI systems. Without actual humans who do the tedious labor of labeling datasets, machine learning and its many real-life applications would be impossible. This image shows 3D-printed figures who work at a computer in an anonymous, dark environment. They are anonymized, almost de-humanized.</p>

<h3>Serif font</h3>
<p><em>Font by <a href="https://www.bbaw.de/en/bbaw-digital/telota" target="_blank">TELOTA</a> / © <abbr title="Berlin–Brandenburg Akademie der Wissenschaften">BBAW</abbr> / <a href="https://github.com/telota/bbaw-schoell" target="_blank"> BBAW Schoell </a> / <a href="https://github.com/telota/bbaw-schoell/blob/master/OFL-1.1.txt" target="_blank">Licensed under OFL 1.1</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The "BBAW Schoell" font is maintained by the Digital Humanities initiative TELOTA at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in order to support various research projects with a font, that can be expanded as required and also used online in digital publications.

  <p>The font "BBAW Schoell" is mainly based on the font "Linux Libertine" and includes therefore all characters of the Linux Libertine. The "Linux Libertine" was selected in a comprehensive evaluation of open source fonts in 2014 because it had the largest character set (regarding the requirements of BBAW projects) and high typographic quality. The letters of the Unicode blocks "Greek and Coptic" and "Coptic" were integrated from the OFL licensed font "New Athena Unicode". In addition, special egyptological characters were designed and added for the purposes of the academic project "Structures and Transformations of the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language: Text and Knowledge Culture in Ancient Egypt".</p>

<h3>Blackletter font</h3>
<p>Font by Paul Lloyd / <abbr title="University of Western Australia">UWA</abbr> / <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Genzsch-Et-Heyse" target="_blank">Genzsch Et Heyse Alternate</a> / Licensed under <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/Genzsch-Et-Heyse" target="_blank">Paul Lloyd Licence Agreement 1.0</a></p>

<p>I chose this font for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="text-list">
  <li>It was created by an academic</li>
  <li>The phrase ‘trials and tribulations’ has a biblical flavour, which in turn evokes images of medieval manuscripts written in this sort of hand</li>
  <li>It references the difficulty of performing <abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> on non-standard typefaces or scripts</li>
  <li>It also makes a nod to the use of gothic fonts in the logos of heavy metals bands, which is the subject of another <abbr title="Digial humanities">DH</abbr> project: <a href="https://noeska.github.io/illegiblesemantics/" target="_blank">&lsquo;Illegible Semantics’</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Numerals on track listing</h3<
<p>As a reminder that digital humanities is is multilingual, and does not solely use Latin script I have chosen to use Thai numerals on the track listing for this album. </p>
