description: "What is #DigitalHumanities? The Album both answers the titular question by adapting lyrics of popular songs, and acts as a provocation to consider what comprises digital humanities."

<p>This site had its genesis one day in 2020 when I was importing some data into Microsoft Excel. The text to columns wizard asked if my data were delimited or fixed-width. I had just been listening to the soundtrack from the musical <em>Wicked</em>, so I had the urge to reply “Delimited! My data are delimited” reworking a line from the song <em>Unlimited</em>.</p>

<p>The following day Quinn Dombrowski <a href="https://twitter.com/quinnanya/status/1306052829891588097" target="_blank">asked on Twitter</a> if anyone else made up songs while data-cleaning, and I knew I wasn't alone. Fast-forward a few months and after spending too much time modifying the lyrics of one song into a DH version, I decided to lean into the idea, and put together a whole album.</p>

<p>The initial idea was that each song would deal with a different aspect of digital humanities. By phrasing the album title as a question – What is Digital Humanities? – I could also play on the idea that digital humanities has a preoccupation with defining the field.</p>

<p>Further, by presenting the songs in a website that follows many of the conventions of a digital edition it could act as a provocation: why is this not a “real” or “serious” digital humanities project? It consists of</p> <ul class="text-list">
  <li>a website</li>
  <li>presenting a collection of texts by the same author.</li>
  <li>encoded in <abbr title="Text Encoding Initiative">TEI</abbr></li>
  <li>annotated for understanding</li>
  <li>by an audience not necessarily familiar with the content</li>
</ul>
<p>How does this differ from, say, <a href="https://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">The Pulter Project</a> (a DH project I admire)?</p>
