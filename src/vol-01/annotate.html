<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol class="text-list">
  <li id="notes-01">Social annotation is the annotation of the same copy of a text by multiple people, either synchronously or asynchronously, so that each person can see, and respond to, the annotations of others. This is often implemented on web-based platforms such as Hypothesis <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/" target="_blank">https://web.hypothes.is/</a> <a class="back" href="#note-01">Back to text</a></li>
  <li id="notes-02">The volunteers for “Citizen Science” projects, such as those hosted on <a href="https://zooniverse.org" target="_blank">zooniverse.org</a>, are not necessarily domain experts, yet still make meaningful contributions to research through classification or annotation tasks. <a class="back" href="#note-02">Back to text</a></li>
