<blockquote>
  <p>This image shows a portrait of a simulated middle-aged white woman against a black background. The scene is refracted in different ways by a fragmented glass grid. This grid is a visual metaphor for the way that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies can be used to simulate and reflect the human experience in unexpected ways. A distorted neural network diagram is overlaid, familiarising the viewer with the formal architecture of AI systems.</p>

<h3>Serif font</h3>
<p><em>Font by <a href="https://www.bbaw.de/en/bbaw-digital/telota" target="_blank">TELOTA</a> / © <abbr title="Berlin–Brandenburg Akademie der Wissenschaften">BBAW</abbr> / <a href="https://github.com/telota/bbaw-schoell" target="_blank"> BBAW Schoell </a> / <a href="https://github.com/telota/bbaw-schoell/blob/master/OFL-1.1.txt" target="_blank">Licensed under OFL 1.1</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The "BBAW Schoell" font is maintained by the Digital Humanities initiative TELOTA at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in order to support various research projects with a font, that can be expanded as required and also used online in digital publications.

    <p>The font "BBAW Schoell" is mainly based on the font "Linux Libertine" and includes therefore all characters of the Linux Libertine. The "Linux Libertine" was selected in a comprehensive evaluation of open source fonts in 2014 because it had the largest character set (regarding the requirements of BBAW projects) and high typographic quality. The letters of the Unicode blocks "Greek and Coptic" and "Coptic" were integrated from the OFL licensed font "New Athena Unicode". In addition, special egyptological characters were designed and added for the purposes of the academic project "Structures and Transformations of the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language: Text and Knowledge Culture in Ancient Egypt".</p>

<h3>Script font</h3>
<p><em>Font by Ruby W Ku / © <a href="https://exeterbookhand.com/" target="_blank">The Digital Exeter Book Hand Project</a> / EBH Initials / <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL" target="_blank"> Licensed under OFL </a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exeter Book Hand (EBH) is a facsimile font set based on the calligraphic style found in the 10th-century Exeter Book.</p>

  <p>EBH aims to be historically authentic through faithful renderings of archaic letterforms, historical ligatures, punctuation and diacritical marks found in the manuscript. EBH comes in four styles: Facsimile, Alternates, Initials, and Runes. The collection is ideal for the creation of facsimiles, palaeography resources and other products with medieval motifs.</p>
