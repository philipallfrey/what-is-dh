<p>If you need a manuscript or three, but! No facsimiles!<br/>
Just come and see me in the archives<br/>
I’ll make a reservation and the items will be waiting<br/>
if you order them up online.<a id="note-01" href="#notes-01">¹</a><br/>
Glitter in the pounce, glitter by the ounce<a id="note-02" href="#notes-02">²</a><br/>
shining just the way you like<br/>
If you’re feeling like you need a copy as a JPG<br/>
You met me at the perfect time</p>

<p>You want them for analysing<br/>
I got your back, I’m digitising<br/>
The NEH is subsidising<a id="note-03" href="#notes-03">³</a><br/>
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>

<p>(I got) UV, white light, raking, back light,<br/>
I can do multi spectral imaging<a id="note-04" href="#notes-04">⁴</a><br/>
I’m digitising<br/>
<span class="instructions">(repeat)</p>

<p>These images are valuable; they illustrate material-<br/>
ity and should be shared online<br/>
We can make them findable, accessible, reusable,<a id="note-05" href="#notes-05">⁵</a><br/>
With IIIF APIs<a id="note-06" href="#notes-06">⁶</a><br/>
Meta-data here, meta-data there<br/>
ISAD(G) 4 life!<a id="note-07" href="#notes-07">⁷</a><br/>
Let’s circulate to scholars so instead of spending dollars<br/>
They can use our copies day or night</p>

<p>You want them for analysing<br/>
I got your back, I’m digitising<br/>
The NEH is subsidising<br/>

<p>I can help you build a static site<a id="note-08" href="#notes-08">⁸</a><br/>
I can help you build a static site<br/>
Cause the long-term maintenance is slight<br/>

<p>The studio’s so cold I want a parka<a id="note-09" href="#notes-09">⁹</a><br/>
When I’m digitising there I freeze my ass off<br/>
But even if I wanted to I can’t stop<br/>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol class="text-list">
  <li id="notes-01">Different archives, libraries, or special collections have their own policies on access and ordering material. Prof. Claire Bourne has compiled a useful guide of questions to ask before and during a visit: <a href="https://www.ofpilcrows.com/blog/2019/3/31/a-working-list-of-questions" target="_blank">https://www.ofpilcrows.com/blog/2019/3/31/a-working-list-of-questions</a>, accessed 10 June 2022. <a class="back" href="#note-01">Back to text</a></li>

  <li id="notes-03">The National Endowment for the Humanities is a major funder of humanities research in the United States of America. This includes digitisation projects, under their Humanities Collections and Reference Resources grants.

  <li id="notes-04">Normal photographs are taken using white or visible light. Ultraviolet light causes parchment to fluoresce, increasing the contrast with the ink. Raking light (i.e. light shone at an angle to the surface) is useful for recording texture, shininess and other fine detail. Transmitted or back light is useful for viewing watermarks and any holes caused by binding or damage. Multi-spectral imaging refers to using light of multiple frequencies (not necessarily visible) to produce an enhanced image compared to what can be seen by the naked eye.<br/>
  For a general discussion of these and other digitisation methods see T. R. Hanneken, “Deep Digitization: Considerations and Tools for Imaging Cultural Heritage Beyond the Basics.” <em>Digital Humanities Conference 2019, Utrecht.</em> <a href="https://jubilees.stmarytx.edu/thanneken/2019/DH2019_Utrecht-paper.html" target="_blank">https://jubilees.stmarytx.edu/thanneken/2019/DH2019_Utrecht-paper.html</a>, accessed 10 June 2022. <a class="back" href="#note-04">Back to text</a></li>
  <li id="notes-05">Best practice for sharing data is summarised by the FAIR principles: data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

  <li id="notes-06">The International Image Interoperability Framework (pronounced triple eye eff) defines a set of standards for sharing images online. These standards are expressed as Application Programming Interfaces, i.e. the formats and functionality that a IIIF-compatible service must provide.

  <li id="notes-08">The Endings Project recommends that for long-term sustainability, project websites should not depend on server-side functionality (e.g. databases, scripts).

  <li id="notes-09">Reading rooms or archival repositories are often climate controlled, to preserve the documents they contain. This is often a lower temperature than is comfortable for people working there. Prof. Megan Cook started a crowdsourced spreadsheet "How Cold Is That Library" for researchers to share their experience and provide advice on what to bring or wear.
