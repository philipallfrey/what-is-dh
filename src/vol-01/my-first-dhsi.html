<p>It was June<br/>
Twenty-ten<br/>
I still think of those days now and then<br/>
My first DHSI <a id="note-01" href="#notes-01">1</a><br/>
And the cluster housing <a id="note-02" href="#notes-02">2</a></p>

<p>Start at eight<br/>
Grab caffeine<br/>
Read some tweets from jotis13 <a id="note-03" href="#notes-03">3</a><br/>
Pass the ferns, spot a deer <a id="note-04" href="#notes-04">4</a><br/>
Leaving cluster housing</p>

<p>And I started to learn<br/>
How to program in R <a id="note-05" href="#notes-05">5</a><br/>
Trying all the commands allowed<br/>
When I finally got it installed<br/>
I was so proud</p>

<p>And the class carried on<br/>
With an expert to help me along<br/>
But I knew even then<br/>
(If I got the funding)<br/>
I’d come back again.</p>

<p class="outdent">(spoken) <em>You’re making me feel I was there too.<br/>
Maybe you were. Make it part of your story</em></p>

<p>My first DHSI<br/>
It was hot, not a cloud in the sky<br/>
Then a crow caught my eye<br/>
Coming from MacLaurin <a id="note-06" href="#notes-06">6</a></p>

<p>He was black<br/>
Not too clean<br/>
There were trees, but he dodged in between<br/>
Yes, he made himself seen<br/>
Coming from MacLaurin.</p>

<p>Then he spied the Nanaimo bar next to my cup <a id="note-07" href="#notes-07">7</a><br/>
And he started to hop towards–<br/>
So I stuffed the last piece in my mouth<br/>
And then he cawed</p>

<p class="outdent">(spoken) <em>I didn’t tell you that<br/>
You didn’t have to. I remember!</em></p>

<p>DHSI was done<br/>
With my laptop in hand I was gone<br/>
But I knew even then<br/>
(If I got the funding)<br/>
I’d come back again.</p>

<p class="outdent">(spoken) <em>Alyssa</em> <a id="note-08" href="#notes-08">8</a></p>
