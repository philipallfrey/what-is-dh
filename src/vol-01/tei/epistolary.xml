          <l>Networks: in or out degree? <note> The “degree” of a node in a network is the number of other nodes connected to it. In a directed network one can also distinguish between indegree (number of inbound links) and outdegree (number of outbound links). In an epistolary network, the indegree of a person would be the number of letters received, and outdegree would be the number of letters sent. See e.g. Martin Grandjean and Mathieu Jacomy (2019), “Translating Networks: Assessing correspondence between network visualisation and analytics”, Digital Humanities 2019, <ref target="https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_31E33B306611.P001/REF">https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_31E33B306611.P001/REF</ref>, accessed 5 April 2023.

          <l>Networks: What’s the best centrality? <note>
          There are several ways of measuring how central a node is to a network: <list>
            <item>Degree centrality: number of connections to other nodes</item>
            <item>Betweenness centrality: number of times on the shortest route between two nodes</item>
            <item>Closeness centrality: average length of the shortest routes to all other nodes</item>
            <item>Eigenvector or PageRank centrality: proximity to well-connected nodes </item>
            </list> See e.g. Grandjean and Jacomy (above, note 2).</note></l>

          <l>And she’s part of the core <note> A network may be divided into a “core and a periphery, such that there are dense connections within the core and sparse connections within the periphery.” Andrew Elliott, Angus Chiu, Marya Bazzi, Gesine Reinert and Mihai Cucuringu (2020) “Core–periphery structure in directed networks”, <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society A.</em> 476: 20190783, <ref target="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2019.0783">https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2019.0783</ref>, accessed 5 April 2023.</note></l>
